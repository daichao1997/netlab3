To use resolve() in proxy

1.call init_mydns(const char * dns_server_ip, 
					uint32_t dns_port,
					const char * client_ip);
	***client_ip is used to find the shortest path, it's not 
	the ip address of proxy but of the client

2.call set_client_ip(const char * client_ip)
	
	if you want to change the client ip address during using
	the nameserver after calling init_mydns()
	use this function

3.call resolve(const char * hostaddr, const char * port,
				const struct addrinfo * hints, struct addrinfo ** res)

	call it like this:
		resolve("video.pku.edu.cn","8080",NULL,&result)

	it's just like getaddrinfo() in UNIX systems


To run nameserver, use
	./nameserver [-r]  <log> <ip> <port> <servers> <LSAs>
